## known issues

  - there can be issues with the lobby being slower than expected, in which case the delays between clicks must be increased
  - there is an issue with the dungeon changing notification blocking some of the clicks. (Ironmace UI problem)
  - there is an issue with some buttons occasionally not functioning until you click somewhere else on the screen first. (Ironmace UI problem)
