# Dark And Darker pre-grame ".ank" scripts

## goal

  Improve the functionality and convenience of Dark and Darker's pre-game lobby

## fuctionality

  Use hotkeys to do common things in the pre-game lobby such as buy, sell, market, queue, and more

## requirements

  dark and darker v73
    - Have most quests done (as some button locations change for things at different affinity levels)

## how to run

  0. Have "auto hotkey v2" installed
  1. Run the script "Keybinds.ank"
  2. Launch "Dark and Darker", Log into a character and be in the Pre-Game Lobby at 1920x1080p res (this doesn't work elsewhere)

## known issues

  - there can be issues with the lobby being slower than expected, in which case the delays between clicks must be increased, adjust making delays faster with prejudice as it can exacerbate this problem
  - there is an issue with the dungeon changing notification blocking some of the clicks. (appears to be a native game UI problem)
  - there is an issue with some buttons occasionally not functioning. (appears to be an native game UI problem)

## todo

  - add full service Super-Key (sell jewels, sell extras, re-squire, buy bandages, buy potions, insta-queue)
