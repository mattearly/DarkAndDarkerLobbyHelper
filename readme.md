# Dark And Darker pre-grame ".ank" scripts

## goal

  Improve the functionality and convenience of Dark and Darker's pre-game lobby

## fuctionality

  Use hotkeys to do common things in the pre-game lobby such as buy, sell, market, craft, queue, and more

## requirements

  - auto-hotkey v2
  - dark and darker v82
    - Have most quests done (as some button locations change for things at different affinity levels)

## how to run

  0. Have "auto hotkey v2" installed
  1. Run the script "Keybinds.ank"
  2. Launch "Dark and Darker", Log into a character and be in the Pre-Game Lobby at 1920x1080p res (this doesn't work elsewhere)

  These are set up in "Keybinds.ank"

## known issues

  - there can be issues with the lobby being slower than expected, in which case the delays between clicks must be increased, adjust making delays faster with prejudice as it can exacerbate this problem
  - there is an issue with some DaD UI buttons occasionally not functioning. (appears to be an native game UI problem)
  - the de-equip routine will sometimes throw things in your stash (especially if you are holding down alt (or have that longstanding native bug were DaD thinks you are pressing alt until you tap it again))
  - Moving your mouse while something is active may cause it to click the wrong place or fail, take hand off mouse while pressing a hotkey for best results
